        <h2>“Now enter the world of Superheroes!”</h2>
        <p>A long red carpet in the first exhibition room 
            takes visitors to what is perhaps the most prized 
            item on display in the exhibition: a copy of Marvel’s 
            very first comic book, published in 1939. Other original 
            artworks include early hand-drawn Black Panther pages 
            sketched by Billy Graham, the first African American to 
            draw the famed character from Wakanda; an original interior 
            page from the first issue of X-Men; and The Incredible Hulk 
            #102 cover, as drawn by one of the few women to work at Marvel 
            in the 1960s, Marie Severin.
