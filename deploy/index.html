                        <p>The exhibition debuts during Marvel’s 80th anniversary year, and chronicles the 
                            story of Marvel and its influence on visual culture, while also uncovering the 
                            narratives of individual characters such as Captain America, Spider-Man, Black 
                            Panther, Captain Marvel, and Doctor Strange.

                        <p>The rooms are laid out chronologically, providing guests with an immersive visual 
                            history of Marvel and its impact on pop culture since its first publication hit 
                            magazine stands in 1939. Three digital workshop studios give hardcore fans the 
                            chance to explore the ins and outs of comic-book production and get a lesson on 
                            some of the illustrators behind the heroes, such as Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve

                                page from the first issue of X-Men; and The Incredible Hulk 
                                #102 cover, as drawn by one of the few women to work at Marvel 
                                in the 1960s, Marie Severin.
